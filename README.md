# React Project 2

#### Project Highlights:
- Broke new ground with React to create a single page site
- Utilized Figma to assist with site creation
- Dynamiclly loading information into components

### More about the site design and insight:
Since I am relativly new to using React, I was unsure where the best place to begin. 
With the first question being: "What kind of site do I make?"

I did plenty of research and ended up on a site called [ARShakir.com](https://www.arshakir.com/) and found site that were designed, but not coded. 
I ended up finding a [site](https://www.arshakir.com/project/freebie-gpt-3-landing-page) that was created in Figma and downloaded the files associated for this project.
